# Should we always use Duck Typed Languages like Javascript for NoSql?

Duck typig is a commom expression used to express that a language id Dynamically Typed.  A common example would be Javascript.  Hence the reason for this document.  It is a question I am askig to the community at large.  NoSql databases privide us with a lot of powerful and useful features, but when paired with a Statically Typed language like Java or C# are we shooting ourselves in the foot?  

Often times we end up running through a ton of acrobatics in order to be able to take dynamice data structures and turn them into a static form for use in our programs, and then we perform the same acrobatics in order to get them back into that dynamic form to persist.  

Challenge:  Try to write this program using Node (Javascript), Python, Elixir, or Lisp.  
Question:  Can we write this program with either less lines of code, or with less complecity by virtue of the Dynamic Typing features of these languages?
